        Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_blank">Read more on Wikipedia</a>

        <li>1889: Albert Einstein is introduced to a family friend called Max Talmud who introduced the boy to books on science and mathematics. Albert starts his quest for facts and information available about the sciences. He attends the Luitpold-Gymnasium in Munich for the next six years</li>
        <li>1894: Due to financial reasons the Einstein family move from Munich to Pavia, Italy. Albert is left in Munich to finish his studies but soon decides to follow the family to Italy</li>
